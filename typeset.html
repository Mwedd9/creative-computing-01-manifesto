    I trust everyone has felt unsure of their content, of the hands it will reach and what people will do with something you have created. Not knowing where this content goes is commonly disregarded because simply put ignorance is bliss and the data collection companies know this mentality. Now imagine a world where you could publish content on a platform where it would be creatively encouraged by a community.
